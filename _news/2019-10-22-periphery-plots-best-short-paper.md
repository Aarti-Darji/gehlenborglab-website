As part of our work on the [Precision VISSTA](/research/projects/precision-vissta/) project to visualize and explore mHealth data, we have developed a novel visualization technique to contextualize heterogeneous time-based charts together Arlene Chung and David Gotz's research groups at the University of North Carolina.

The paper describing this technique has won the inaugural Best Short Paper Award at IEEE VIS 2019, the premier conference for data visualization research and application. Congratulations to student researchers Bryce Morrow (UNC) and Trevor Manz (Harvard) for this success!
