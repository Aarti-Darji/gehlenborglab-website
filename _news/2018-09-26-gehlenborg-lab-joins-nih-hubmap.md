The lab will be part of the new NIH Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) [announced today](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-build-detailed-map-cells-within-human-body) along with several other Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) and Harvard faculty. A [news item](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/news/faculty-join-nih-hubmap) on the DBMI website describes in more detail how we will be involved in this exciting new program to understand how human tissues are organized and function on a molecular level.
