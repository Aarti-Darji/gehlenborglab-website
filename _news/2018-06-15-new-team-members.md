Angela Chen is a summer intern in the BD2K Summer Internship program in our department and will be working on a storytelling framework for [HiGlass](http://gehlenborglab.org/research/projects/higlass/). Lina Chi is a Lecturer at La Trobe University in Australia and will be staying with us for a month to work on visualization approaches for health insurance claims data provided the Australian government.
