Data-Driven Visual Consent is a web application that can be used during the surgical informed consent process. It uses AI to calculate personalized risk scores and incorporates patient preferences to render a visualization that allows patients to make a truly informed decision on whether to undergo surgery. The goal is to improve patient understanding of their potential outcomes while aiding both the surgeon and patient to engage in shared decision making.
