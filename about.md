The Gehlenborg lab develops computational tools that enable data-driven 
biomedical research, with a focus on visualization and exploration of 
genomics and epigenomics data. Currently, the lab is researching and
developing  novel tools to visualize heterogeneous data from large-scale cancer 
genomics studies, integration of visual and computational approaches 
to support sense-making in biology, and software to support reproducible 
research in epigenomics and genomics. Research is funded by NIH/NHGRI, 
the NIH Common Fund, and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.
