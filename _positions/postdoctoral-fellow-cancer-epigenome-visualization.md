We are hiring a Postdoctoral Fellow to join the Gehlenborg Lab to develop novel visualization methods and tools for the [Cistrome](http://cistrome.org) project. This project is highly interdisciplinary and being conducted in close cooperation with the group of X Shirley Liu at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, providing an excellent opportunity for collaborative research.

The goal of the lab is to improve human health by developing computational techniques and interfaces that enable biomedical and clinical investigators to efficiently interact with biomedical data. We design, implement and evaluate methods and tools that leverage the knowledge and cognitive skills of investigators in order to enable the interpretation of massive heterogeneous data sets that integrate genomic and clinical data.

Our lab in the Department of Biomedical Informatics is part of a vibrant community of scientists, physicians, and engineers whose goal is to advance the boundaries of knowledge. The Department has recently been formed at Harvard Medical School to lead development of computational and informatics techniques to address pertinent challenges in modern biological sciences and medicine. The Departmentâ€™s faculty conduct research at the intersection of biomedicine and information sciences, including bioinformatics, functional genomics, translational medicine, and clinical knowledge management. Based on the Harvard Medical School Longwood Campus, it provides a rich scientific environment, with many seminar series and invited speakers of the highest caliber.

#### Responsibilities
The postdoctoral fellow will be responsible for developing novel methodologies and applications to facilitate visual analysis of large epigenomics data sets. While the focus of the position is on the development of visualization approaches, the roles will also involve the integration of such tools with data analysis and data management tools.

Other responsibilities include day-to-day project management, including coordination with collaborators and other team members, as well as the writing of manuscripts. Contribution to the grant writing efforts of the lab are expected.

#### Basic Requirements
Candidates must have a PhD degree in a quantitative field such as bioinformatics, computational biology, biomedical informatics, medical informatics, computer science or related fields and a track-record of publication in the top journals or conferences of their field. Hands-on experience with management, analysis, and visualization of biomedical data as well as experience in developing (web-based) interactive software tools are highly desired for this position. Excellent programming skills and working knowledge of state-of-the-art software development techniques are essential. The candidates interested in these positions must be highly motivated, willing to learn and demonstrate initiative in assigned tasks. Excellent written and verbal communication skills are crucial.

#### Additional Requirements
Experience with Python, JavaScript, web application development and cloud computing are desirable. Previous research experience in areas such as genomics or epigenomics will be beneficial.

#### Terms
The position is available immediately and can be renewed annually.

#### How to Apply
Candidates should submit their CV, a research statement, PDFs of their three best papers, and contact information for three references to nils@hms.harvard.edu with [POSTDOC] in the subject.

Harvard Medical School is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.
