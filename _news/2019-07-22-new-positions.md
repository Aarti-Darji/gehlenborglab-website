The lab is involved in numerous collaborative projects to develop tools for data visualization of molecular data, including spatial single-cell atlas data as part of the NIH HubMAP consortium, genome interaction data as part of the 4D Nucleome project, and large-scale epigenome data through the NCI ITCR program and the Cistrome project.

We are also hiring a senior data curator to lead data curation efforts for the rapidly growing HuBMAP program, as well as software engineer for the Refinery Platform and Harvard Stem Cell Commons project.
