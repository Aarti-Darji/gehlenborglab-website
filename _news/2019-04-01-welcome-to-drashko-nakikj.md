The lab is welcoming new postdoctoral fellow Drashko Nakikj, who graduated from the PhD program at the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University, where he was advised by Dr. Lena Mamykina. Under her supervision he did research on two types of software tools: ones that support knowledge sharing in clinical settings and others that help patients get information of interest from, and make sense of, long discussions in online health forums, while at the same time stimulating social connections between the participants.
