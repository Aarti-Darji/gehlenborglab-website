  blurb: '"Using bioinformatic algorithms, researchers can query chromatin-contact datasets to find all such structures. But these algorithms may return thousands of hits. How is a researcher to study them? Enter HiPiler. Developed by Gehlenborg’s lab in collaboration with the lab of Hanspeter Pfister at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard, HiPiler excises these features and presents them on a canvas as miniature snippets — basically tiny segments of the full-sized contact map, which users can then organize, sort, and cluster based on parameters such as noise or location."'
