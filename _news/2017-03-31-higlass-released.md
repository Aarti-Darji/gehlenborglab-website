blurb: HiGlass is a web-based exploration tool for Hi-C and other genomic interaction maps that provides multi-scale and comparative visualizations.
---

[HiGlass](http://higlass.io) ([http://higlass.io](http://higlass.io)) is a web-based viewer for genome interaction maps featuring synchronized navigation of multiple views as well as continuous zooming and panning for navigation across genomic loci and resolutions. It can be applied for visual comparison of Hi-C and other genomic data from different experimental conditions to efficiently identify salient outcomes of experimental perturbations, generate new hypotheses, and share the results with the community.

A [preprint](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/31/121889) describing HiGlass and several use cases is available on the [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/31/121889).
