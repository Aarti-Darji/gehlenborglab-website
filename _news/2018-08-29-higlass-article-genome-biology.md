We are excited to announce that an article describing [HiGlass](/research/projects/higlass/) has been [published in Genome Biology](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1486-1) earlier this week. HiGlass is a web-based viewer for genome interaction maps featuring synchronized navigation of multiple views as well as continuous zooming and panning for navigation across genomic loci and resolutions. We have put together a brief [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/pkerpedjiev/status/1034164351048007680) that summarizes the key features of HiGlass.

Congratulations to Peter Kerpedjiev for successfully leading this effort!
